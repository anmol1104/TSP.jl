# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Given a graph `G = (N,A)` with set of nodes N and set of arcs `A` with arc traversal 
cost `c·µ¢‚±º ; (i,j) ‚àà A`, the objective is to develop a least cost route visiting every 
node exactly once.

This package uses Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm to find an 
optimal solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem given ALNS optimization 
parameters,
- `kÃ≤`     :   Number of ALNS iterations triggering operator probability update (segment size)
- `lÃ≤`     :   Number of ALNS iterations triggering local search
- `lÃÖ`     :   Number of local search iterations
- `kÃÖ`     :   Number of ALNS iterations
- `Œ®·µ£`    :   Vector of removal operators
- `Œ®·µ¢`    :   Vector of insertion operators
- `Œ®‚Çó`    :   Vector of local search operators
- `œÉ‚ÇÅ`    :   Score for a new best solution
- `œÉ‚ÇÇ`    :   Score for a new better solution
- `œÉ‚ÇÉ`    :   Score for a new worse but accepted solution
- `œâ`     :   Start tempertature control threshold 
- `œÑ`     :   Start tempertature control probability
- `ùúÉ`     :   Cooling rate
- `CÃ≤`     :   Minimum customer nodes removal
- `CÃÖ`     :   Maximum customer nodes removal
- `ŒºÃ≤`     :   Minimum removal fraction
- `ŒºÃÖ`     :   Maximum removal fraction
- `œÅ`     :   Reaction factor

and an initial solution developed using one of the following methods,
- Clarke and Wright Savings Algorithm   : `:cw`

The ALNS metaheuristic iteratively removes a set of nodes using,
- Random Removal    : `:random!`
- Rekated Removal   : `:related!`
- Worst Removal     : `:worst!`

and consequently inserts removed nodes using,
- Best Insertion    : `:best!`
- Greedy Insertion  : `:greedy!`
- Regret Insertion  : `:regret2!`, `:regret3!`

In every few iterations, the ALNS metaheuristic performs local search with,
- Move  : `:move!`
- 2-Opt : `:opt!`
- Swap  : `:swap!`

See example.jl for usage

Additional initialization, removal, insertion, and local search methods can be defined.
