# TODO LIST

In no particular order
- Improve efficiency of move!(rng, kÌ…, s) with use of relatedness metric to avoid complete enumeration of positions within the route.
- Improve efficiency of inertion to reduce complete re-evaluation of insertion cost in ever iteration.
- Calibrate ALNS parameters for improved solution quality as well as run time.
